# 🎬 Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews  

## 📢 Project Overview  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze **movie reviews** and predict their sentiment as **positive** or **negative**.  
It is built using **Python, Streamlit, Scikit-learn, and NLTK** and provides an interactive **web-based application** for real-time analysis.  

## 🚀 Features  
✔ **Real-time Sentiment Prediction** – Enter a movie review and get instant feedback  
✔ **NLP Preprocessing Pipeline** – Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
✔ **TF-IDF Vectorization** – Transform text into numerical data for model training  
✔ **Machine Learning Model** – Trained using Logistic Regression  
✔ **User-Friendly Web App** – Simple UI built with **Streamlit**

📊 How It Works
1️⃣ User Inputs a Movie Review
2️⃣ Text Preprocessing – Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization
3️⃣ TF-IDF Vectorization – Converts text into numerical form
4️⃣ Machine Learning Model Prediction – Logistic Regression predicts sentiment
5️⃣ Result Displayed in Web App
📌 Future Enhancements
🔹 Improve Model Accuracy – Try using Naïve Bayes, SVM, or LSTMs
🔹 Deploy on Cloud (AWS/GCP) – Make it accessible worldwide
🔹 Build a Sentiment Dashboard – Visualize trends over time
